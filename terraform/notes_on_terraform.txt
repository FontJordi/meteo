To set up terraform, follow the instructions of the official page: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli

Once terraform is installed, open a new directory and copy the files of the terraform folder.
Create a secret.tfvars file with the following contents:

db_username = "(your_db_username)"
db_password = "(your_db_password)"

This is used to store sensitive information in a safe manner. Do not share these contents.

To set up the infrastructure on aws set on main.tf open a terminal and run:

terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="secret.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="secret.tfvars"

To ssh into the ec2 instance, notice that we created on aws a key pair called "myKey" and replicated it on our folder. Run

chmod 400 myKey.pem

Before 

ssh -i myKey.pem ec2-user@(Public IPv4 address of the ec2 instance)

Remember to add an inbound rule on the security group of the ec2 instance to allow connections on port 22 from your IP.
