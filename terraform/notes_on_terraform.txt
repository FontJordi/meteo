To set up terraform, follow the instructions of the official page: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli

Once terraform is installed, open a new directory and copy the files of the terraform folder there.
Create a secret.tfvars file with the following contents:

db_username = "(your_db_username)"
db_password = "(your_db_password)"
pub_key     = "ssh-rsa (key)"

This is used to store sensitive information in a safe manner. Do not share these contents. pub_key is the key generated for 
your ec2 instance to access it via ssh

to set up the infrastructure set on main.tf open a terminal and run:

terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="secret.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="secret.tfvars"
