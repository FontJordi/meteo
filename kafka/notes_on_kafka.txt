To run kafka:

Download kafka and extract it:

$ tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.7.0.tgz (latest version)
$ cd kafka_2.13-3.7.0

I used zookeeper, start the zookeeper service:
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

In another terminal, start the kafka broker service:
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

I used 3 brokers just to learn how I could do it and use the advantages of kafka (partitioning, replication)
To set up a new broker, copy the file server.properties, rename it (for example server-1.properties) and change

    -the broker.id
    -listeners
    -log.dirs

every broker must have a different broker.id, listener and log.dirs

Create a topic to store events:
$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

Here you can add --partitioning and --replication. Remember that the replication value cannot be higher than the number of brokers.
localhost:9092 is the default local server and port. It has to be the listener of any of your brokers.

Once the topic is created, you can activate the producer.py. Remember to change the server, port and topic in the producer.py accordingly.
