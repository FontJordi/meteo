Metabase is an open-source business intelligence (BI) tool easy to set up and run.

We will set it up on an ec2 instance, first connect to the ec2 instance using the ssh key created by terraform:

ssh -i myKey.pem ec2-user@(ipv4 address of ec2)

Download it from https://www.metabase.com/start/oss/jar on your ec2 instance

Then run java -jar metabase.jar. This will launch a Metabase server on port 3000.

Connect to the UI on http://(ec2 instance ipv4):3000

Set up the databse connection, make sure the ec2 instance can access the databse (security groups, etc)

You are now ready to create any dashboard
